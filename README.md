Welcome to the LR project! 
This work was developed to understand the role of ligands and receptors in cross-disease risk. 
In order to reproduce the findings of our manuscript you will need access to a few public datasets and databases, details of which are available in the key resource table (resources/KRT.txt). All libraries and library versions are also listed. This project also makes use of a custom built library (mellon) which is available in the repository itself. 
A description of what each script does and which figure(s) it generates, see resources/script_descriptions.csv. To regenerate plots and results from this work, run the scripts in order of the script number (i.e. Starting with 00 up to 08).
