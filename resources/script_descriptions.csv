,,
,"Bootstrapped data generation: using a list of genes expressed in the human brain, a random list of genes with matching size as a given disease is selected. % of LRs in that list is calculated.",

01-clustering_genes_and_diseases,Script to,
, - visualise in a heatmap all the genes associated with each disease,
,- extract psychiatric genes,
,- estimate total overlap in genes,
02a_bootstrapped_disease_comparisons,This script compares,
,- how many LRs and LRIs overlap across diseases,
,- distances between networks (pairwise),
,"- generates bootstrapped data to compare to real values, these are protein-expressing genes known to act as LRs",
,- for LR/LRIs the quantile of the distribution in which the real data falls is extracted,
,-for distances the empirical pvalue is calculated,
